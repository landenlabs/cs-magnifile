Prior to using the process graphing feature you must enable logging on one or more Processes in the main window.
Click on the left <b>Log</b> column in the main process window to toggle logging on and off.
<br>Optionally Press the <b>Summary</b> button to view the Log 'summary' data available for graphing.
<p>
Select items on the <b>ProcData</b> tab to graph process specific data.

<tr><td>WorkSet</td><td>The working set of a program is a collection of those pages in its virtual address space that have been recently referenced. It includes both shared and private data. The shared data includes pages that contain all instructions your application executes, including those in your DLLs and the system DLLs. As the working set size increases, memory demand increases.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Virtual Size</td><td>The value returned by this property represents the current size of virtual memory used by the process. The operating system maps the virtual address space for each process either to pages loaded in physical memory, or to pages stored in the virtual memory paging file on disk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Virtual (Peak) Size</td><td>Peak (maximum) virtual size </td></tr>
<tr><td>Paged Size</td><td>The amount of memory, in bytes, allocated by the associated process that can be written to the virtual memory paging file.</td></tr>

<b>Legend:</b><br>
<li>When you select a series in the legend panel, it will highlight the series in the graph panel.

<li>When you click on the Width, Scale or Offset columns it will open a text box.
You can enter a number or drag the mouse while the left button is down to adjust the value.

<li>Click on the Axis or Type column will open a combo box to select values.
<p>
<b>Chart:</b><br>
<li>When you left click over an axis, the text will turn red and you can drag to change the maximum domain.
<li>When you right click over an axis, you can drag its domain up and down.
<li>When you right click over the chart you can drag the time line left and right.
<li>When you click on a series it will draw a dot on the nearest series value and display a label. 
The label will show the raw value and the adjusted value.  The adjusted value is the result of applying any scale or offset.
<b> adjValue = value * scale + offset </b>
